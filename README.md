# LunCo – vision video
Video that explains what LunCo (Lunar Colony) sim is about

This video is a compulation of opensource projects builds using Godot.

The beauty of opensource is that you do not have to reinvent the wheel.

LunCo will incorporate certain mechanics as well as contribute to development of modules it's build from

1. Uses **git lfs** to store binary files e.g. Blender, meshes, etc
2. Blender 3.1.2 video sequencer
3. Godot 3.5-rc2
